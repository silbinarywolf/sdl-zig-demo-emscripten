## Credits

* [Sokol Zig](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-zig) for having a nice Emscripten install / build setup that I was able to mostly copy for this project.
* [Raylib-Zig](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig) for giving for their Emscripten setup which is how I initially got up and running.
* [Andrew Kelley](https://github.com/andrewrk/sdl-zig-demo) for Zig itself, their SDL demo code and everything!
